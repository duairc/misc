Miscellaneous Stuff
===================

This is just a collection of miscellaneous little things I've written. It includes:

* `bandcamp`, download albums from Bandcamp for free
* `brainfuck`, a Brainfuck interpreter written in Ruby.
* `eircom`, a really simple script for generating WEP keys from eircom SSIDs. Usage: `eircom XXXX XXXX`. Derived from [Eircog](http://github.com/nosmo/eircom).
* `Makefile`, see [this comic](http://xkcd.com/149).
* `mkay`, a Ruby program that translates [mkay](http://github.com/andrew-wja/mkay) into Brainfuck. Its output may be piped through `brainfuck'.
* `snakey`, a cute little program that my girlfriend and I wrote. Usage: `snakey [size] [slowness]`
