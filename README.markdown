Miscellaneous Stuff
===================

This is just a collection of miscellaneous little things I've written. It includes:

* `brainfuck', a Brainfuck interpreter written in Ruby.
* `Makefile', see [this comic](http://xkcd.com/149).
* `mkay`, a Ruby program that translates [mkay](http://github.com/andrew-wja/mkay) into Brainfuck. Its output may be piped through `brainfuck'.
* `snakey`, a cute little program that my girlfriend and I wrote. Usage: `./snakey [size] [speed]`
